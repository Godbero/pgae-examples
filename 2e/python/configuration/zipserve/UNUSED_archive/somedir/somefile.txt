The app URL /archive/somedir/somefile.txt serves this file because
URLs under /archive/ are mapped to the zipserve handler, and this file
exists in the archive named archive.zip, as somedir/somefile.txt.

The UNUSED_archive directory has the same contents as the ZIP archive,
and is here so you can see what's in it.  The app does not use this
directory, it gets this file from the archive.
